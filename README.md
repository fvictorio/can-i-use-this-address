# Can I use this address?

Check if an ethereum address is known to be compromised. Add addresses whose private keys you know are public by sending
a transaction in the Rinkeby testnet.

This list is not exhaustive, not even close. But you can be sure that an address marked as unsafe here shouldn't be used
in mainnet.
